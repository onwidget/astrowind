## Demo

<br>

## Getting started

**AstroWind** tries to give you quick access to creating a website using [Astro](https://astro.build/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a free theme focuses on simplicity, good practices and high performance.

Very little vanilla javascript is used only to provide basic functionality so that each developer decides which framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid JS...) to use and how to approach their goals..

### Project structure

Inside AstroWind template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── data/
|   └── blog/
|       ├── post-slug-1.md
|       ├── post-slug-2.mdx
|       └── ...
├── public/
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── images/
|   |   └── styles/
|   |       └── base.css
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── atoms/
│   │   ├── blog/
│   │   ├── core/
|   |   └── widgets/
|   |       ├── Header.astro
|   |       ├── Footer.astro
|   |       └── ...
│   ├── layouts/
│   |   |── BaseLayout.astro
│   |   └── ...
│   ├── pages/
│   |   ├── [...blog]/
|   |   |   ├── [...page].astro
|   |   |   └── [slug].astro
│   |   ├── [...categories]/
|   |   |   └── [category]/
|   |   |       └── [...page].astro
│   |   ├── [...tags]/
|   |   |   └── [tag]/
|   |   |       └── [...page].astro
│   |   ├── index.astro
|   |   ├── 404.astro
|   |   └-- rss.xml.js
│   ├── utils/
│   └── config.mjs
├── package.json
└── ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.

### Configuration

Basic configuration file: `./src/config.mjs`

```javascript
export const SITE = {
  name: 'Example',

  origin: 'https://example.com',
  basePathname: '/', // Change this if you need to deploy to Github Pages, for example
  trailingSlash: false, // Generate permalinks with or without "/" at the end

  title: 'Example - This is the homepage title of Example',
  description: 'This is the homepage description of Example',

  googleAnalyticsId: false, // or "G-XXXXXXXXXX",
  googleSiteVerificationId: false, // or some value,
};

export const BLOG = {
  disabled: false,
  postsPerPage: 4,

  blog: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: 'blog', // blog main path, you can change this to "articles" (/articles)
  },

  post: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: '', // empty for /some-post, value for /pathname/some-post
  },

  category: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: 'category', // set empty to change from /category/some-category to /some-category
  },

  tag: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: 'tag', // set empty to change from /tag/some-tag to /some-tag
  },
};
```
