## 📗 Project Structure

Inside AstroWind template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── images/
|   |   └── styles/
|   |       └── base.css
│   ├── data/
|   |   └── posts/
|   |       └── post-1.md
|   |       └── ...
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── core/
|   |   ├── icons/
|   |   └── widgets/
|   |       └── Header.astro
|   |       └── Footer.astro
|   |       └── ...
│   ├── layouts/
│   |   |── Base.astro
│   |   └── ...
│   ├── pages/
│   |   ├── blog/
│   |   ├── index.astro
|   |   └── 404.astro
│   └── utils/
└── package.json
└── ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the assets folder if they are imported directly.
