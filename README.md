# 🚀 AstroWind I18n

This branch `i18n` contains an experiment to apply internationalization (i18n) to **AstroWind**. It requires a lot of engineering work and there is still a long way to go to mix with the main branch. Subtle and intelligent changes are required to go from a site without the need for internationalization to one with internationalization. Also, it uses [astro-i18n-aut](https://github.com/jlarmstrongiv/astro-i18n-aut) integration which has a lot of potential but is still in early versions.

Although attempts are made to update frequently, this branch `i18n` may not have the latest version of the **AstroWind** code. Use this branch for now as a guide to establishing internationalization with **AstroWind**. It is not the only possible way.

By default, the robot configurations have been updated so that the Demo cannot be indexed in search engines. You can update these settings in `public/robots.txt` and in `src/config.yml` at various levels.

This branch has been possible thanks to the great work of @reuseman.
