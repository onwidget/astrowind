## Switching from Wordpress


Switching from WordPress to a simpler, leaner content management system like one based on Markdown files (.md or .mdx) could be a smart move for several reasons, especially when it comes to cost savings and efficiency. WordPress, while powerful, can come with a lot of overhead—bloated plugins, themes, and the need for frequent updates and maintenance. 

## What about server costs?

All of this adds up in terms of server costs, developer hours, and potential performance issues. By cutting out the bloatware, you’re streamlining your website’s infrastructure, which means faster load times and reduced expenses on hosting and maintenance. In turn, this optimization could help increase your site's SEO ranking and user experience, leading to more conversions and revenue.
